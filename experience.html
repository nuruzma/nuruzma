        <p>During my free time i like to learn new language such as Korean and Japanese</p>
        <p>I also get to learn more about art and technology such as digital drawing and design, video editing using editing software and mobile apps, 
        a little bit of music editing and arrangement</p>
        <p>A part from that i also likes to learn new instrument and learning singing as I found music is amazing and interesting as it helps me to educe my stress and maintain my mental heaalth</p>
        <p>As for learning a new language, it can helps me to understand the language better and it giving me a chance to communicate better in a different country in the future</p>
        <p>A for working experience, I havent got any working experience yet during my student year as i have not get any chance in finding a part time job</p>
